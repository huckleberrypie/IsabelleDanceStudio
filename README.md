# Isabelle Dance Studio

Decompiled Unity sources for the now-delisted American Girl mobile game originally developed by Splashworks. This was done mostly as an exercise out of boredom for the past few weeks, and as a bit of a video game preservation effort since I do enjoy the game as a quick way to pass the time.

App bundles for the original iOS and Android releases can be downloaded at the links below:<br />

You can also download the full VPK here in case the VitaDB release isn't working out for you:

Special thanks to hatoving and ParkingLotGames for their help in making this possible.

## Features
* Essential game functionality, of course
* Upgraded to Unity 2018.2.19f1 from Unity 4.3.2
* Support for platforms such as the PlayStation Vita

## Issues
* Compiling for PC works, but the resulting game comes with missing sprites and broken logic

## TODO
* Add a simple localisation script (JSON or something along those lines, idk) to aid in fan translations?
* Port the game to modern Android and iOS versions
