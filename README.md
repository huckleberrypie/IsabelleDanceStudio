# Isabelle Dance Studio
Decompiled Unity sources for the now-delisted American Girl mobile game. This was done mostly as an exercise out of boredom for the past few weeks, and as a bit of a video game preservation effort since I do enjoy the game as a quick way to pass the time.

Special thanks to hatoving and ParkingLotGames for their help in making this possible.

## Features
* Essential game functionality, of course
* Upgraded to Unity 2018.2.19f1 from Unity 4.3.2
* Support for platforms such as the PlayStation Vita

## TODO
* About/Privacy and How to Play text is broken
* Alpha textures exhibit a greyish cast for some reason
* Add a simple localisation script (JSON or something along those lines, idk) to aid in fan translations?
* PC builds end up with missing sprites (Shader-related issue?)
